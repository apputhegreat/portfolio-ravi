                        <p>Being a UX Designer with prior Developer experience, I have a blend of both the skills which enables me
                          to communicate my design ideas clearly with the team. It also helps me to collaborate with developers and product
                          managers synergistically which makes the entire development process smooth and fast.
                          My goal is to not only focus on aesthetic of an interface but also to incorporate concepts like empathy, user
                          research, personas, usability testing to make the informed decisions and deliver a delightful and an outstanding
                          user experience.<br>
                          On November 2014, I co-founded PocketChef, a food delivery startup. While working towards converting
                          this idea into a reality, I had a privilege of working on various
                          things from Idea generation, shaping it into a product, and managing teams to optimizing operations to maximize
                          profitability and maintaining the growth to sustain the business etc. In the entire process, the one thing fascinated me the most was the design process.
                          I was amazed by the impending concept of design thinking and how it revolutionizes the entire business
                          development process.
                          With an inquisitive mind and self-driven enthusiasm, I decided to learn more about UX design.
                          I quickly learned tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, Axure RP, etc. and concepts like user-centered
                          design, user research, persona, user journey map, usability evaluation, design studio, wireframing,
                          prototyping etc. and started using them in my freelance projects.
                          Soon, I decided to completely shift my role from a developer and become a full-time UX designer.
                          Currently, I am working as a UX designer/Project Manager at Mobi Cloud Services funded by Ananth Technologies.</p>

                      <p>About the company</p>
                        <span> PocketChef is a Hyderabad based food tech startup. It offers most affordable and yet quality solution to our daily problems of finding a good meal. Planning of the whole idea started in November 2014 and launched in October 2015.
                        For startups, it’s important to “go live” as soon as possible and start generating revenue. This definitely drives a sense of urgency to launch. Once the strategy and goals are well defined, most companies move straight to launching their brand. Logos, website design, and social media hit the top of the list.

                      <span>The Brand is the most important experience you deliver to your customers. The entire essence of branding is the connection between company and customer, learning to understand the customer and why they should love our product. Once we understand the customer and what drives them to our product, we can create our brand’s visual identity. For a start-up like us, branding was the key factor to gain trust of a customer when there were already big players in the market in the same domain.

                      Chef implies food. So, the basic idea came from the name.
                      Many people suggest to go with the wordmark initially, and once idea becomes a success and starts
                      generating profit, go for a brand change that would give you much more customers...

                            SmallBite is a food delivery start up operating in Pune. It sells quality food at a very reasonable price.
                            In India, there are many food delivery start-ups like Foodpanda, Tinyowl, Swiggy etc. and all of them have a very similar kind of model. They get food from already existing restaurants, and sell it to the customers. In the entire process, they take delivery charge from the customers, in addition to the commission from restaurants. Smallbite’s model is quite different from them. It displays the list of curated meals upfront on its application so that users doesn’t have to browse through the long menus of every restaurant before placing an order. Along with this, they have their own kitchens to ensure better quality of the food, and ultimately higher user satisfaction.

                      <span>
                        In Chemical industry, if one wants to buy or sell any of the goods then one has to go through a tedious process of searching for the brokers, who again search for the right buyers or sellers and negotiate with them on behalf of their clients for price. And, because of this long process, sometimes quality of the goods deteriorates before they see the light of the day.
                        So, to solve this problem a client asked me to implement an idea into prototypes. Idea was to develop a platform for the clients and brokers to make this process of buying and selling goods easy and fast.<br>
                        I started this project in the mid of August, 2016.
                        Now, I’ll take you through the design process I used to create the application described below.

                      all the information related to functionality which would further help me in designing the task

                      with the client, I finalized “must have” features that would be the part of MVP. Once all the

                        Established in 1998, MBW Furniture is Atlanta’s top authorized online seller of exquisite custom hand-made furniture and fine imported furniture. They work directly with select manufacturers around the world that are known for their commitment to standards above excellence.

                      In the Old design, one of the problem was -these features were not prominent and therefore users were not using them and hence revenue got down. Our target was to design the new website in such a way that it allows users to find valuable features easily and use them.

                        Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you had to buy more to save some money?,
                        Have you ever bought two pairs of the same items just because of the BOGO offer, but never used
                        the second one?, Have an offer ever put you off just because you do not want two similar items?
                        If yes, then SplitnSave is the perfect solution for the situation. It is a mobile application used
                        for selling and buying deals/offers at a discounted price. It is operational in some states of the USA.

                      of the offer, post it on the SplitnSave mobile application and ask for a split price which in this case
                      might be 50%. When someone agrees to your deal, you and the person each gets half of the deal and save
                      50% of the money.

                      So, the challenge was to design a user-friendly interface which allows users to upload and share any

                        Redwheels is the new way of buying cars in India, a better way. One where you get to see
                        upfront offers from the best dealers in India, without the hassle or haggle. It turns the
                        traditional way of car buying on it’s head — no more awkward negotiating on the dealership
                        forecourt, you tell the car you want and they get dealers to compete over you. Your contact
                        information is never shared with dealers until you accept an offer from a dealer thereby
                        ensuring that you won’t be hassled by any unwanted sales calls.

                      Client had already done some basic user research, so I started the project with requirement
                      gathering for MVP(Minimum Viable Product). First, I interviewed client to understand the car
                      selling business. I asked them some questions like - how Redwheels is going to be different
                      than others?, what is the revenue model?, who are their users? etc. to learn about their
                      philosophy. Second, I prepared some questions to know about the functionalities that I was going
                      to incorporate into the design.<br>
                      <b>2. Competitive analysis</b> -
                      Once, I had enough functional information, I performed competitive analysis to compare the
                      features others(like TrueCar, Vroom, Carwale/Cartrade/Truebil) were offering and what Redwheels
                      is going to offer so that they could get competitive advantage. Based on the analysis, I
                      suggested client to add some features. In addition to features comparison, I also did research
                      on their design, information architecture, visuals which could help me during the course of the

                        Urban/Rural area survey is an important part in the development of any economy. It is imperative that
                        a base map for any urban body should be timely updated to help in planning and implementing the schemes
                        such as waters supply, sanitation etc. At the same time the information on properties and hoardings in the
                         concerned area are going to help in generating revenue.<br>
                         India is one of the biggest economies in the world. With the huge population, it is difficult to
                         gather the information about all the areas, its people, and their properties. It’s a tedious and
                         complicated process. Ananth Technologies is an expert in providing GIS base map for the Urban bodies.
                         Their GIS (Geographical Information Systems) department works towards — getting basic data from the
                         satellite along with actual data from the ground; correcting and merging them; submitting them to the
                         government.

                      <span>
                        One day, one of my friends was feeling little low and needed a dose of Serotonin, a happiness hormone.
                         He started browsing for apps on the Play Store which display motivational quotes and liners from the famous
                         people and movie/tv series. Based on the download counts and good reviews, he downloaded some of them. However,
                         when he looked at all the apps he could not find one which had a good user experience as well as quality content.
                         Being a UX Designer, I took this up as a challenge and decided to design and develop an application that
                         will have a good user experience as well as quality content.

                       their download count and started downloading them. After complete analysis, some of the important issues we found
                       which required immediate attention were:<br>
                       1. Most of the applications were overloaded with content. None displayed curated quality content.<br>
                       2. All applications were full of long content. No one wants to read long content as human’s attention
                       span has decreased over the time.

                        inexperienced developer with little knowledge on client and server side languages like Java,
                         JavaScript etc. But, he not only quickly adapted and absorbed the latest technologies but excelled
                          with time. He is the most proactive member in the team and is always ready to help, take
                          any unplanned task and deliver it on time even. He is a very
                          reliable resource who believes in smart work. His thrust for knowledge and learning will
                          surely take him to greater heights. He will be an asset to any organization. I wish him all
