                  <p>Urban/Rural area survey is an important part in the development of any economy. It is imperative that
                    a base map for any urban body should be timely updated to help in planning and implementing the schemes
                    such as waters supply, sanitation etc. At the same time the information on properties and hoardings in
                    the concerned area are going to help in generating revenue. India is one of the biggest economies in the
                     world. With the huge population, it is difficult to gather the information about all the areas, its
                     people, and their properties. It’s a tedious and complicated process. Ananth Technologies is an expert
                     in providing GIS base map for the Urban bodies. Their GIS (Geographical Information Systems) department
                      works towards — getting basic data from the satellite along with actual data from the ground; correcting
                      and merging them; submitting them to the government.</p>

                      <h3 class="section-heading">Current process</h3>
                      <p>Before developing the new process, everything was manual and on paper. Technology was leveraged
                        in very few places in the entire process. Below are the high-level steps GIS team has been following
                        for a while:<br>
                        <ul>
                          <li><p>1. Collect the High-resolution satellite image/data of the selected urban area from the third
                          party (PMU) and conducte Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) survey for geometric and
                          radiometric corrections to create a base map.</p></li>
                          <li><p>2. Collect maps and data from government and local agency. Incorporate cadastral and utility
                            information like outlines of all the bodies (house, roads, tanks, water bodies etc.) and annotate
                             them using ArcGIS Software.</p></li>
                          <li><p>3. Send the team to on-site with the survey forms for collecting information about the area.
                             It includes going to each house, asking information like owner name, plot area, number of floors
                             etc…</p></li>
                          <li><p>4. Send collected data to Ananth Office through courier for further processing.</p></li>
                          <li><p>5. Use ArcGIS to correct, merge, and delete data to process the gathered/collected data.</p></li>
                          <li><p>6. Send final data to the client for the verification. After verification, sign off process
                             starts which includes sending all the document’s hard copy and soft copy to the client.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                      </p>
                      <h3 class="section-heading">Problems</h3>
                       <p>The key issue with old process is the time spent to complete the entire project. There are many
                          steps in the process where if proper digitalization were present, significant time and money
                          would have been saved. Like:
                          <ul>
                            <li><p>&#9679 &nbsp Collection of data on the ground — Everything is on a paper form which takes more time
                               to fill than a digital form. Also there is a high chance of losing the papers during
                               transportation.</p></li>
                            <li><p>&#9679 &nbsp Sending data to the Ananth office for further processing takes more time to reach when
                              survey area is far.</p></li>
                            <li><p>&#9679 &nbsp Millions of data have to be added in an excel sheet for further processing.
                              It take days to complete</p></li>
                            <li><p>&#9679 &nbsp Losing data during the project timeline delays the project completion.</p></li>
                          </ul>
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="section-heading">The Challenge</h3>
                        <p>Develop an application which works on both mobile and tablet to reduce the time and improve the
                          efficiency involved in all the processes during the entire lifecycle of the project by using
                          technology and better user experience.
                        </p><br>
                        <h3 class="section-heading">Discussions</h3>
                        <p>Before the project started I wanted to know everything about the current process, problems with them
                           and scope of improvement. For almost a week, my team and I discussed with the GIS team about the
                           project. To understand the problem deeply, I interviewed many team members who were involved in
                           different processes. Once we all had sufficient knowledge on the project we started discussing
                           the solutions that can be used to improve the processes.
                        </p><br>
                <h3 class="section-heading">Approach (Design process)</h3>
                <p>I used user-centered design process in the entire project lifecycle.
                  <img class="img-responsive" src="img/lasso/lasso_1.jpeg" alt=""/>
                  <h3 class="section-heading">User research (User Story, Persona)</h3>
                  <p>The first step in the process is to learn about your audience. As we were building a product for the
                     internal team, I started taking interviews of all the stakeholders to know about the business requirement
                     and goals. Then I started taking interview of the people who were actually going to use the product. I asked
                    them all kind of questions like:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><p>&#9679 &nbsp  What their life in a day looks like?</p></li>
                      <li><p>&#9679 &nbsp What problems they face in the current process?</p></li>
                      <li><p>&#9679 &nbsp What are their pain points?</p></li>
                      <li><p>&#9679 &nbsp What are the improvements in the current process they want?</p></li>
                      <li><p>&#9679 &nbsp What functionalities they want to see in the new system?</p></li>
                    </ul>
                  <p>I used the above findings to create a generalized persona which helped the team to focus on the user’s
                    need during the entire project lifecycle. As the product was going to be used by two different people with
                    two different skills, I created two personas — one for the supervisor who are going to manage the entire
                     project and other — the data executive who is going to visit on-sites to collect data.</p>
                  <p><b>Supervisor</b></p>
                  <img class="img-responsive" src="img/lasso/lasso_persona_1.png" alt=""/>
                  <p><b>Data Executive</b></p>
                  <img class="img-responsive" src="img/lasso/lasso_persona_2.png" alt=""/><br><br>
                  <h3 class="section-heading">User Stories</h3>
                   <p>After defining the audience I started writing user stories which will be used to develop functionalities.
                      Some of the stories are below:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li><p>&#9679 &nbsp Balakrishna should be able to create, assign and delete projects.</p></li>
                        <li><p>&#9679 &nbsp He should be able to see the progress of the project through a dashboard.</p></li>
                        <li><p>&#9679 &nbsp Ramesh should be able to login and see his task assigned by the supervisor for that day.</p></li>
                        <li><p>&#9679 &nbsp He should be able to enter the information collected at the ground and sync it to the database.</p></li>
                        <li><p>&#9679 &nbsp He should be able to split or delete any task based on the requirement.</p></li>
                        <li><p>&#9679 &nbsp He should be able to take pictures of the property.</p></li>
                        <li><p>&#9679 &nbsp He should be able to Mark tasks complete and see them in the complete tab.</p></li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>With each story in mind, I started conducting Design studios with the team. I asked everyone to draw
                      designs appropriate for the functionality we were trying to build.</p><br>

                  <h3 class="section-heading">Designs (Wireframes)</h3>
                   <p>These are the designs developed in photoshop after many iterations, testings, and interviews with the
                     stakeholders and team.</p>
                   <div class="row">
                     <div class="intro col-md-4 col-sm-12 fade-left ">
                         <img id="test" class="img-responsive" src="img/lasso/lasso_screen_1.jpeg" alt=""/>
                     </div>
                     <div class="intro col-md-4 col-sm-12 fade-left ">
                         <img id="test" class="img-responsive" src="img/lasso/lasso_screen_2.png" alt=""/>
                     </div>
                     <div class="intro col-md-4 col-sm-12 fade-left ">
                         <img id="test" class="img-responsive" src="img/lasso/lasso_screen_3.png" alt=""/>
                     </div>
                   </div>
                   <div class="row">
                     <div class="intro col-md-12 col-sm-12 fade-left ">
                         <img id="test" class="img-responsive" src="img/lasso/lasso_screen_4.png" alt=""/>
                     </div>
                   </div><br><br>
                   <h3 class="section-heading">User Testing</h3>
                    <p>After completion of the initial designs, I started user testing. I asked all the team members,
                      stakeholder (Tester) and supervisor (Tester), and data executive (Tester) to come under one roof
                      and start testing the design right away. It began with distributing printed copies of all the designs
                      to all the members and asking them to write down their comments/feedback. Once feedback process completed,
                      we picked each comment and asked everyone’s opinion on it. With this process, we keep on filtering out things
                      we can remove, add and improve in the further iterations. This is one of the most important steps in the entire
                      design process. Once it is completed and new designs were ready, incorporating all the suggestions given by the
                      team members, they went for development.<br><br>
                      My job did not end here. I participated in all the development meetings to make sure that everyone is on
                      the right path and focused on the user for whom we are building this product. In addition to this, I
                      provided all the visual elements like graphics, images, icons to the team and reviewed the entire design
                      once it was complete to make sure it complies with the standards.</p><br>
                    <h3 class="section-heading">Tools/Technologies</h3>
                     <p>After defining the audience I started writing user stories which will be used to develop functionalities.
                        Some of the stories are below:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li><p>&#9679 &nbsp Tools used for the project:<br>
                              Whiteboard, Pen/Paper, Photoshop for wireframing, Illustrator for graphic designs, Marvel for dynamic
                              prototyping, Lucidchart for user flows, Google drive for storage, Android/iOS mobile and Tablet for testing.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><p>&#9679 &nbsp Technologies used:<br>
                              React, Expo, Smartsheet, Firebase
                          </p>
                        </li>
                      </ul><br>

                      <p style="color:#000;">Overall, this project was a success. We were able to reduce the completion time by 30% and save a lot
                         of money.<br>
                        Personally, I learned a lot while working on this project which includes GIS domain knowledge,
                        technologies like expo, firebase, and smartsheet and most importantly how to work and collaborate
                         with the cross functional team inside a company.
